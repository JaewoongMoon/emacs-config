My first class in computer programming was an elective course in BASIC back in sixth grade. I chose that class because I thought that computers were powerful and capable ofdoing many interesting things. Electives usually have a reputation for being fun, but my classmates and I heard stories about the difficulty of this course and how only on e or two kids ever got A's. I thought to myself, "Maybe they just weren't interested in computers. But I am, so how bad could it really be?"

Petty Bad! Forget learning anything that encouraged us to think, wonder and explore, We were asked to study the history of computers, memorize the names of hardware, and master of rules of syntax. We were sixth graders. We weren't about to enter the high-tech world of programming. All we wanted was to see what neat things we could do with the computers. The class wasn't difficult at all; memorization is hardly a challenge if you take the time to do it. There were so few A's because no one cared to do busy work, and that's all that was offered. 

"After my sixth grade BASIC experience, I never wnated to take another computer course again."

Of course, when you are eleven years old, G.P.A and class rank don't mean much to you. But by the time I was about to enter my junior year in high school.
