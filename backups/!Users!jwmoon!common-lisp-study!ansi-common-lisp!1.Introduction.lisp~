; 1. Introduction
; Part of what makes Lisp distinctive is that it is designed to evolve.
; You can use Lisp to define new Lisp operators.
; As new abstractions become popular (object-oriented programming, for example),
; it always turns out to be easy to implement them in Lisp.
; Like DNA, such a language does not go out of style.

; 1.1 New Tools
; Why learn Lisp? Because it lets you do things that you can't do in other
; languages. If you just wanted to write a function to return the sum of the
; numbers less than n, say, it would look much the same in Lisp and C:
; Lisp
(defun sum (n)
)
