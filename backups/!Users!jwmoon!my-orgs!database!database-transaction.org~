* The ACID properties

** Atomic 
All work that must be performed by the database inside a transaction

- that is, reading data, deleting data, updating data, and/or inserting data

- is treated as a single unit of work. It's literally all-or-nothing. 

If anything fails, then it all fails, and you revert back to the way the universe

was before you'd gone and mucked it all up.

** Consistent



** Isolated



** Durable
