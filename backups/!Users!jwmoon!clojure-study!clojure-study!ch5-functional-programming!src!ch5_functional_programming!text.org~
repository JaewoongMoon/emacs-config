** Pure Functions: What and Why


A function is pure if it meets two qualifications:

 + It always returns the same result if given the same arguments.
 + It can't cause any side effects.

pure functions rely only on 1) their own arguments and 2) immutable

Mathmatical functions, for example, are referentially Transparent:

If a function relies on an immutable value, it's referentially Transparent.
The string ", Daniel-san" is immutable, so the following function is 
referentially transparent:
